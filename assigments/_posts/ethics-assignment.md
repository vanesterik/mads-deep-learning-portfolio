## Introduction

For the lecture of ethics, we are asked to research ethical models. This to get a better understanding of how to approach ethical dilemmas in the field of data science.

I will perform a relatively simple literature study in order to gain knowledge on this field and comply with the assignment. I will research two ethical models, compare them, and state my preference. Finally, I will explain which model I believe is most suited for data ethics.

## Method

The requirements for this literature study are as follows:

- Research internationally since the field of ethics is globally relevant.
- Do not restrict the search to any timeframe as ethics is a long-standing field of study.
- Focus on peer-reviewed journals and conference papers to ensure the quality and credibility of the sources.
- Use keywords such as "ethical models", "ethical frameworks", "decision making", and "list of ethical models" to find relevant literature.

## Results

Initially, I found a comprehensive article (Status.net. (2023, August 15)) that outlined various ethical decision-making models (e.g. Kaplan University. (n.d.)), After reading this article and the references it provided, I was able to identify several other relevant sources (Potter Box. (2023), Oregon State University. (n.d.), Smith, J. (2024)).

Below a table summarizing and comparing four notable models:

| Model Name                            | Key Features                                                                                                          | Strengths                                                               | Weaknesses                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The PLUS Model                        | Focuses on Policies, Legal, Universal, and Self as filters for evaluating decisions.                                  | Encourages comprehensive analysis by considering multiple perspectives. | May be too broad and lack specific guidance for complex situations.        |
| The Potter Box                        | A four-step model that includes understanding facts, identifying values, applying principles, and choosing loyalties. | Provides a clear and structured approach to ethical decision-making.    | Results in varying interpretations of ethical dilemmas.                    |
| The Seven-Step Guide                  | Integrates a flowchart approach to systematically analyze the ethical dimensions of a situation.                      | Provides a visual and intuitive way to navigate ethical decisions.      | May oversimplify complex ethical issues.                                   |
| The Ethical Decision-Making Algorithm | Introduces a roadmap in order to develop ethical algorithms for decision-making.                                      | Provides a systematic approach to ethical decision-making by algorithms | May be too narrow in focus and not account for all ethical considerations. |

## Discussion

The fact that these models were so easy to find, leads me to believe that there are many more models out there. This was also eluded to in the lecture by *Sjors Goosens*.

With this in mind I would expect a model that is specifically designed for data ethics to exist. The only exception to this is *The Ethical Decision-Making Algorithm*, as this is not really a model but a roadmap to develop ethical algorithms.

## Conclusion

After comparing the models, I find *The Potter Box* to be the most appealing. It provides a clear and structured approach to ethical decision-making, which is crucial in the complex field of data science. Its emphasis on understanding facts, identifying values, applying principles, and choosing loyalties aligns well with the multifaceted nature of ethical dilemmas in data science. However, I do acknowledge that it may lead to varying decisions based on individual interpretations of ethical dilemmas.
